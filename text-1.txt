anthony hopkins cbe (born 31 december 1937) is a welsh actor, director, and producer.[2] one of britain's most recognisable and prolific actors, he is known for his performances on the screen and stage. hopkins has garnered numerous accolades throughout his career spanning over six decades, including two academy awards, three british academy film awards, a british academy television award, two primetime emmy awards and a laurence olivier award. he has also received an honorary golden globe award and the bafta fellowship from the british academy of film and television arts. in 1993, he was knighted by queen elizabeth ii for his services to the arts, and in 2003, he received a star on the hollywood walk of fame for his achievements in the motion picture industry.

anthony hopkins was born in the margam suburb of port talbot on 31 december 1937,[6] the son of annie muriel (née yeates) and baker richard arthur hopkins.[7] he stated his father's working-class values have always underscored his life, "whenever i get a feeling that i may be special or different, i think of my father and i remember his hands – his hardened, broken hands."[5] his school days were unproductive; he would rather immerse himself in art, such as painting and drawing, or playing the piano, than attend to his studies. in 1949, to instill discipline, his parents insisted he attend jones' west monmouth boys' school in pontypool. he remained there for five terms and was then educated at cowbridge grammar school in the vale of glamorgan. in an interview in 2002 he stated, "i was a poor learner, which left me open to ridicule and gave me an inferiority complex. i grew up absolutely convinced i was stupid."[8]

anthony hopkins was understudying me and walked away with the part of edgar like a cat with a mouse between its teeth.[12]

anthony hopkins. his hitler is mad, often contemptible, but always understandable. part of the problem, perhaps, is that the monster becomes a little too understandable. he is not made sympathetic, exactly, but he is given decidedly pathetic dimensions, making him just that much more acceptable as a dramatic and historical character."[56] for his performance he received a primetime emmy award for outstanding lead actor in a limited series or movie. that same year he starred as paul the apostle opposite robert foxworth as saint peter in the biblical drama and miniseries peter and paul (1981).
